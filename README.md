# How this started ❓
I was planning to learn RUST,<br>
but I realised it has way too many restrictions and rules <br>
I don't like rules, I write my own code, my own way. <br>
In my journey of finding an alternative to RUST,<br>
I found Zig interesting. I believe Zig will be the future of coding.

# What is this ❓
In my journey of learning Zig,<br>
I will use https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book for learning,<br>
so everything you see here is based on the book,<br>
it might be of great use if you want to learn Zig.

# Not To Forget :
Have fun learning ! <br>
