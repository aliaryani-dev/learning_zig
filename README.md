<strong>got bored of this language. Just wanted to get familiar with some of its ideas. I'm moving to C++. Goodbye Zig</strong>
# What is this ‚ùì
In my journey of learning Zig,<br>
I will use https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book for learning,<br>
so everything you see here is based on the book,<br>
it might be of great use if you want to learn Zig.

# List of Chapters (Will be updated) üìö
* 01_hello_world : A simple hello world code with Zig
* 02_objects : real fun begins here. it's a collection of variables, constants, strings , arrays , and many more things !
* 03 : wait for it ...

# How this started ‚ùì
I was planning to learn RUST,<br>
but I realised it has way too many restrictions and rules <br>
I don't like rules, I write my own code, my own way. <br>
In my journey of finding an alternative to RUST,<br>
I found Zig interesting. I believe Zig will be the future of coding.

# Not To Forget :
Have fun learning ! <br>
