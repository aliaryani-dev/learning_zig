~~got bored of this language. Just wanted to get familiar with some of its ideas. I'm moving to C++. Goodbye Zig~~ <br>
__Guess who's back!__
# What is this ❓
In my journey of learning Zig,<br>
I will use https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book for learning,<br>
so everything you see here is based on the book,<br>
it might be of great use if you want to learn Zig.


# Not To Forget :
Have fun learning ! <br>
